<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 5</h1>

Woo hoo! Survived week one! :-)

I learned a lot about image types and when to use which ones. I did not appreciate
the differences between jpg, png, and gif and have been using them indiscriminantly
up to this point. Oops!

There was a lot of learning about branching and merging today. It's easy to
forget where you are in the project, so I learned that I can't just skip over
those helpful messages generated by the various git commands (for example,
  the part that tells you that you're in a branch and not in master like
  you thought). There are also some idiocyncracies on GitHub that take getting
  used to, but I feel like overall I'm understanding it fairly well - just need
  more practice for it to become second nature. 

  Looking forward to diving deeper into functions next week. :-)
