<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 2<h2>

I felt like I learned a lot on day 2. Diving into doing a substantial amount of
coding was great - that's really the way I learn best. I'm really enjoying the
process of troubleshooting my own code, though sometimes it can be frustrating
(e.g., took me a while to figure out an error was caused by a missing ">"). It
gives me a great sense of accomplishment to construct something tangible that
has a function and a certain look. I'm definitely looking forward to more
complex topics that allow me to add more functionality and better layout/look.
