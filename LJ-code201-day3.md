<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 3</h1>

Today I feel like I learned a lot. Or, more accurately, there were things I knew
in the abstract that became more practical for me. I really like atom and its
color coding - it immediately gives me hints on whether or not I've messed the
syntax up and how. Not everything is caught by the linter as errors, but the
color coding often gives it away. There's no help with logic flaws on my part,
but that's understandable.

This is definitely an ongoing project, and even as I finish the assignment,
including the stretch objectives, there is still so much more that I can do (for
example, more user input verification). But there's only so much time. I want
to do more, but I don't have time. I have a suspicion that the entire class
will be like that. ;-)
