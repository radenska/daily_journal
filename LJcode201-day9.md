<h1>LJ Code 201 day 9</h1>

Well, today CSS kicked my ass as I expected, but I do feel like I learned a lot (hopefully, I will retain some of it.) One thing I got some experience with is how the fixed position works (and doesn't work), how to use relative ALONG with absolute, that in fact it works to have a relative element and an absolute element inside a fixed element... I hadn't really thought about how to use several different types of layouts together. I'm sure I have a lot more learning to do (and probably lots of what I did I shouldn't do that way as best practices), but at least I feel like I'm beginning to understand certain layout concepts a lot better.

I'm still somewhat stymied by CSS at times as it seems that stuff sometimes just doesn't work, and often I can't figure out why. (for example, I'd use the vertical align property on an element and the alignment does't change (and is not vertically aligned)) Fun times! ;-)
