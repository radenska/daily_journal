<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 13</h1>

Today was pair work day, and as I have every time we've done this in class, I learned a lot from my partner. I wouldn't want to do pair work all the time because, at least for me, it does take much longer to complete the task, but I learn so much from talking through things with someone else and seeing how another person approaches a task, and whenever I'm explaining my logic behind wanting to do something, it solidifies the concepts in my mind better. But, there are a finite number of hours in the day and if I did pair work every day, I'd have no time for sleep. And I like sleep. ;-)

I have been trying for the past couple of days to get two html pages to be controlled by the same js file (in this case, after the survey is finished, the user clicks a button to see results and are redirected to a different page for that). The redirection was easy, but I could not figure out why my js file would not render the results on the results.html page. I finally gave up and split up the js files, but I'd like to know what I wasn't doing correctly.

The other learning landmark today is that I finally managed to use the .forEach array function. I've been trying to do this for two weeks now, and for some reason, even after copious googling and reading, I just couldn't figure out the syntax. Today when I went back to it, it suddenly seemed easy and obvious for some reason. However, there are still some quirks to work out as it did not function as expected for some things (I tried it in several different places in my app.js file). But YAY! I thought I'd never figure that thing out.
