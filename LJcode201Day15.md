<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 15</h1>

Well, class time  is over!

Today I learned about prototype, and about different aspects of functional programming. I'm looking forward to transitioning to more functional programming from beginner (though obviously, I'm still very much a beginner).

I also feel like some of CSS is starting to make more sense as I continue to work on the chocolate pizza project.
