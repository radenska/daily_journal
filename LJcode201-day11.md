<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 11</h1>

Started a new project today - yay! Doing the stretch goals for the previous project really helped me with this one since those goals exposed me to a lot of the things we're doing in the Bus Mall project (more and different types of events, inserting buttons via js).

Also, today I decided to work with classmates. This usually results in me writing my code a lot slower, but I think it's beneficial to both me and my classmates (hopefully!) to talk to them and work stuff out together. Also, when I have to explain something to someone, it better solidifies the concept in my mind, or at the very least makes me aware that I don't actually understand something that well. Additionally, I like looking at other people's code as a way to learn to debug and to see what other ways people are accomplishing the same task.

I've been trying to figure out the use of forEach for two weeks now, and it's driving me nuts. It seems so simple, yet I'm missing something.... grrrrrr!
