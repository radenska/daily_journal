<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 8</h1>

Today continued to reaffirm that working with/near others is a great idea. Even if I'm "just" helping someone else, I always learn from their code and get ideas on how to approach things in my own code that I hadn't thought of before. And, of course, explaining things to people solidifies my own understanding of them.

It definitely took a bit of time to understand the structure of how the js interacts with html forms, but once I did, it made writing the code much more intuitive.

I also started exploring (upon a suggestion from a classmate) using ems instead of pixels or % for sizing in CSS, as well as trying out some other CSS properties. That is, as it has been for years, very much a work in progress.
