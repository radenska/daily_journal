<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 10</h1>

I didn't make it to class today due to Snowpocalypse, but I did still learn a lot, I think.
I liked the part about putting in code to catch potential errors, either as a way of troubleshooting code that doesn't work, or to catch errors caused by factors we can't control (e.g., information coming from elsewhere). I'm looking forward to exploring that more at some point.

The wireframe assignment was... evil. So evil. I think I have an understand of CSS and how it cascades and what gets inherited, but there's a lot of little minutae. A LOT. Like the fact that many properties only work when put together with other properties, but finding out which ones they are and what they go with is a long, frustrating process. Fun times! :-)

And then, stuff just behaves weirdly and I can't tell why a lot of the time. But I do feel accomplished for actually making the wireframe mostly correctly, without resorting to making every single element absolute and calculating offsets in pixels for them (I was tempted at one point).

Settings for margins are particularly unfathomable in how (or even if) they're going to actually work. I'm sure it all makes sense to someone, but that someone, sadly, isn't me yet!
