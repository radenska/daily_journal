<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 12</h1>

Ah, the day of joyous charts.js! A great tool! I learned that the syntax is a disaster of spacing, brackets, bracing, commans, colons, and semicolons. Oh, and parentheses, of course. Once you figure that out, it makes awesome charts. For some reason, atom kept telling me the Chart object was undefined, and I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out how to fix that "error." It turns out that it worked just fine, and I never did get the angry red line of linter doom to disappear. There's definitely lots of little details with charts that require diligent looking up and studying if one wants refined control of the chart output.

The other thing I tried to do today was send the user to a new page when they click the results button (easy), and then render the charts and table summary there (not so easy). I'm not sure how that is supposed to work, because I couldn't get it to work. Maybe today! :-)
