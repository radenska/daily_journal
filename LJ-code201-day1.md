<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 1</h1>

Today has been very frustrating. Things are moving painfully slowly. I'm hoping
this is all just a "first days are weird" thing and that, tomorrow, we will
have a lot more hands on time actually practicing coding. I did like learning
about the various shortcuts - they will be great time savers in the future.
