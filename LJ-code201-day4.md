<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 4</h2>

I loved the pair programming today. Even though the assignment was fairly simple,
it was still a great opportunity to learn from and with a colleague at our own
pace. In class, we learned about using incrementation, and when we should use
which syntax, which was helpful. I also learned about the array.push method,
which is much more efficient (at least for my use in this week's project) than
what I was doing previously, which is using a counter to fill the array of
user responses in the game.
