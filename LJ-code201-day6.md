<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 6</h1>

I learned a lot today about working with objects, and object syntax (though I think I learned more about what syntax DOESN'T work than what syntax DOES work ;-) ). It will definitely take some time to get fully into the mindset of using objects efficiently, but I think I'm making progress.

While I think I have an ok grasp of how the DOM works in terms of using javascript to "look at," modify or add html elements and context, the practical side of that is very much still a work in progress.
